The application program is fairly easy. First we have an input where we press either 1 or 2. 1 asks the user to log in while 2 means we want to exit the program. 
Pressing one means the user has to select a valid user either otherwise the program will terminate. Once the user presses a valid user id the program starts. 
The user here has four options. Search for a business, search for a user, make a friend, or add a review. Each option is activated when the user presses 1, 2, 3 or 4. 
The application repeats until the user pressed anything other than the selected numbers. Once the user presses a button other than the given, the application terminates.
